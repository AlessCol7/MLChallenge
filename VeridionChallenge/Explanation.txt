After analyzing the data and the documents provided, I began thinking about similar challenges I’ve worked on before. For natural language processing, I initially used GloVe and later enhanced it with an LSTM. However, this approach didn't seem suitable for this task, mainly because the data wasn't labeled.
I started by downloading the necessary libraries and preprocessing the data. Then, I applied GloVe, which is designed to capture the semantic relationships between words to provide more accurate classifications. Upon testing, I noticed that out of the 220 available labels, the model only selected three labels, with a majority focused on Oil Manufacturing.
Next, I explored different combinations of dataset columns to see which might lead to a more accurate classification. Unfortunately, these adjustments did not yield better results, as presented in the notebook. I also tested a Random Forest Classifier and a Neural Network on top of GloVe, but the classification results worsened, with the model outputting binary classifications despite using a softmax activation function.
When I tried applying an LSTM, I switched to using TF-IDF instead of GloVe. TF-IDF is particularly effective in capturing word frequency and calculating the inverse document frequency, which seemed better suited for this dataset, especially considering the importance of business tags. After running the model and analyzing the results, I found that TF-IDF provided more diverse and accurate label assignments. When 
I applied the LSTM on top of the TF-IDF it gave unsatisfying result, foccusing on generalising the data and giving only a couple of insurance labels that I tested in the Trials.ipynb.
In conclusion, the results presented in the file VeridionChallenge/company_insurance_classification.csv represent the most accurate classification I was able to achieve.



**Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis**

**Strengths:**
1. **Simplicity and Efficiency:** The TF-IDF and cosine similarity approach is lightweight and computationally efficient compared to deep learning methods. It requires minimal preprocessing and no training, making it quick to implement and test.
2. **Interpretability:** The similarity-based approach provides an intuitive way to understand why a company was assigned a particular insurance label. Higher similarity scores indicate stronger textual relevance.
3. **Scalability for Medium-Sized Datasets:** Since TF-IDF only requires computing a term-document matrix and similarity scores, it scales well for datasets with thousands of companies and labels.
4. **Decent Initial Accuracy:** The method provides reasonable classification accuracy for well-defined business descriptions that closely match insurance taxonomy labels.

**Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Handling Ambiguous or Uncommon Descriptions:** The model struggles with vague, poorly worded, or domain-specific company descriptions that do not clearly align with insurance categories.
2. **Lack of Context Understanding:** Since TF-IDF is purely statistical, it does not capture contextual meaning like embeddings-based models (e.g., BERT). Companies with similar but differently phrased descriptions might receive inconsistent classifications.
3. **Scalability Issues with Large Datasets:** Although efficient for moderate datasets, TF-IDF’s computational cost increases with dataset size due to matrix operations.
4. **Assumption of Closest Match Being Correct:** The method assumes that the highest similarity score corresponds to the correct label, which may not always be true.
5. **Long Tail Performance:** Less common insurance categories with fewer representative words in their labels may be harder to classify accurately.

**Scalability Considerations**
- **Current Performance on Large Datasets:** TF-IDF scales better than deep learning models but still faces performance challenges as data size grows. A dataset with millions of companies would require optimizations such as sparse matrix representations and approximate nearest neighbors for similarity calculations.
- **Potential Improvements:** Using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., SVD) or switching to embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT could improve scalability and accuracy without significantly increasing computational cost.

**Critical Thinking and Self-Assessment**

1. **Where does my solution work great? Where does it struggle?**
   - Works well when company descriptions contain clear keywords that align with insurance taxonomy labels.
   - Struggles with ambiguous, incomplete, or jargon-heavy descriptions that do not directly match predefined labels.

2. **Have I tested the long tail?**
   - The method may perform poorly on rare insurance categories. Testing with edge cases (companies that don’t fit neatly into common labels) is necessary to evaluate true performance.

3. **What do I know I don’t know about the solution?**
   - The model’s robustness against mislabeled or noisy data is unclear.
   - The impact of using alternative text representations (e.g., word embeddings) on classification accuracy remains unexplored.

4. **How well can it run on huge amounts of data?**
   - Computational efficiency remains manageable for datasets up to a few hundred thousand records, but performance may degrade significantly with millions of records.
   - Optimizations such as approximate similarity search (e.g., FAISS) or incremental TF-IDF computation could help scale better.

5. **What trade-offs did I make between accuracy and computational efficiency?**
   - Chose TF-IDF over deep learning to prioritize interpretability and speed.
   - Sacrificed some accuracy by not using context-aware embeddings like BERT.

6. **What did I learn during this project that I didn’t know before?**
   - TF-IDF can be highly effective for text classification when domain-specific keywords are well-represented.
   - Similarity-based approaches require careful consideration of label specificity and potential overlap.
   - The importance of validating results with qualitative analysis rather than relying solely on similarity scores.

7. **What should I learn to be even better at this?**
   - Explore more advanced NLP techniques, such as transformer-based embeddings (BERT, Sentence-BERT) for improved context understanding.
   - Investigate semi-supervised learning techniques to improve classification accuracy with minimal labeled data.
   - Optimize large-scale text similarity computations using efficient nearest-neighbor search techniques.

### **Future Work and Enhancements**
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combining TF-IDF with word embeddings could improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency.
- **Active Learning:** Incorporating human feedback to refine model performance over time.
- **Dynamic Taxonomy Updates:** Allowing the taxonomy to evolve as new insurance categories emerge.
